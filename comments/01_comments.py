# The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in
# code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must
# have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them,
# but their use is not a cause for celebration.


# Comments do not make up bad code
